## Introduction

`AloeStackView` is a class that allows a collection of views to be laid out in a vertical or horizontal list. In a broad
sense, it is similar to `UITableView`, however its implementation is quite different and it makes a different set of
trade-offs.

We first started using `AloeStackView` at Airbnb in our iOS app in 2016. We have since used it to implement nearly
200 screens in the app. The use cases are quite varied: everything from settings screens, to forms for creating a new
listing, to the listing share sheet.

`AloeStackView` focuses first and foremost on making UI very quick, simple, and straightforward to implement. It
does this in two ways:

* It leverages the power of Auto Layout to automatically update the UI when making changes to views.

* It forgoes some features of `UITableView`, such as view recycling, in order to achieve a much simpler and safer API.

We've found `AloeStackView` to be a useful piece of infrastructure and hope you find it useful too!

## Example App

The repository includes a simple [example iOS app](Example).

You can try it out by cloning the repo, opening `AloeStackViewExample.xcworkspace`, and running the app.

The example app shows a few ways `AloeStackView` can be used to implement a screen in an iOS app.

## Usage

### Creating an AloeStackView

The primary API is accessed via the `AloeStackView` class.

You can create an instance of `AloeStackView` quite easily in your code:

```swift
import AloeStackView

let stackView = AloeStackView()
```

`AloeStackView` is a `UIView` (specifically a `UIScrollView`), and thus can be used in the same way as any other
view in your app.

Alternatively, if you want to build an entire `UIViewController` using `AloeStackView`, you can use the convenient
`AloeStackViewController` class:

```swift
import AloeStackView

public class MyViewController: AloeStackViewController {

  public override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    stackView.addRow(...)
  }

}
```

`AloeStackViewController` is very similar to classes such as `UITableViewController` and
`UICollectionViewController` in that it creates and manages an `AloeStackView` for you. You can access the
`AloeStackView` via the `stackView` property. Using `AloeStackViewController` rather than creating your own
`AloeStackView` inside a `UIViewController` simply saves you some typing.

### Adding, Removing, and Managing Rows

The API of `AloeStackView` generally deals with "rows". A row can be any `UIView` that you want to use in your UI.

By default, rows are arranged in a vertical column, and each row stretches the full width of the `AloeStackView`.

The `axis` property on `AloeStackView` can be used to change the orientation. When `axis` is set to `.horizontal`,
rows are arranged next to each other, left-to-right, and the `AloeStackView` scrolls horizontally, with each row
stretching the full height of the `AloeStackView`.

To build a UI with `AloeStackView`, you generally begin by adding the rows that make up your UI:

```swift
for i in 1...3 {
  let label = UILabel()
  label.text = "Label \(i)"
  stackView.addRow(label)
}
```
![Add rows](Docs/Images/add_rows.png)

If the length of an `AloeStackView` ever grows too long for the available screen space, the content automatically
becomes scrollable.

![Add rows](Docs/Images/add_many_rows.gif)

`AloeStackView` provides a comprehensive set of methods for managing rows, including inserting rows at the
beginning and end, inserting rows above or below other rows, hiding and showing rows, removing rows, and retrieving
rows.

You can customize the spacing around a row with the `rowInset` property, and the `setInset(forRow:)` and
`setInset(forRows:)` methods.

The class documentation in [AloeStackView.swift](Sources/AloeStackView/AloeStackView.swift) provides full details of
all the APIs available.

### Handling User Interaction

`AloeStackView` provides support for handling tap gestures on a row:

```swift
stackView.setTapHandler(
  forRow: label,
  handler: { [weak self] label in
    self?.showAlert(title: "Row Tapped", message: "Tapped on: \(label.text ?? "")")
  })

label.isUserInteractionEnabled = true
```
![Add rows](Docs/Images/tap_handler.gif)

A tap handler will only fire if `isUserInteractionEnabled` is `true` for a row.

Another way of handling tap gestures is to conform to the `Tappable` protocol:

```swift
public class ToggleLabel: UILabel, Tappable {

  public func didTapView() {
    textColor = textColor == .red ? .black : .red
  }

}

for i in 1...3 {
  let label = ToggleLabel()
  label.text = "Label \(i)"
  label.isUserInteractionEnabled = true
  stackView.addRow(label)
}
```
![Add rows](Docs/Images/tappable_protocol.gif)

Conforming to `Tappable` allows common tap gesture handling behavior to be encapsulated inside a view. This way
you can reuse a view in an `AloeStackView` many times, without writing the same tap gesture handling code each
time.

### Dynamically Changing Row Content

One of the advantages of using `AloeStackView` is that you can keep a strong reference to a view even after you've
added it to an `AloeStackView`.

If you change a property of a view that affects the layout of the overall UI, `AloeStackView` will automatically relayout
all of its rows:

```swift
stackView.setTapHandler(forRow: label, handler: { label in
  label.text = (label.text ?? "") + "\n\nSome more text!"
})
```
![Add rows](Docs/Images/dynamically_adjust_content.gif)

As you can see, there's no need to notify `AloeStackView` before or after making changes to a view. Auto Layout will
ensure that the UI remains in an up-to-date state.

### Styling and Controlling Separators

`AloeStackView` adds separators between rows by default:

![Add rows](Docs/Images/add_rows.png)

#### Turning Separators On and Off

You can easily hide separators for any rows that are added to an `AloeStackView`:

```swift
stackView.hidesSeparatorsByDefault = true
```
![Add rows](Docs/Images/hide_separators_by_default.png)

The `hidesSeparatorsByDefault` property only applies to new rows that are added. Rows already in the
`AloeStackView` won't be affected.

You can hide or show separators for existing rows with the `hideSeparator(forRow:)`,
`hideSeparators(forRows:)`, `showSeparator(forRow:)`, and `showSeparators(forRows:)` methods.

`AloeStackView` also provides a convenient property to automatically hide the last separator:

```swift
stackView.automaticallyHidesLastSeparator = true
```
![Add rows](Docs/Images/hide_last_separator.png)

#### Customizing Separators

You can change the spacing on the left and right of separators:

```swift
stackView.separatorInset = .zero
```
![Add rows](Docs/Images/zero_separator_inset.png)

In vertical orientation, only the left and right properties of `separatorInset` are used.

In horizontal orientation, separators are displayed vertically between rows. In this case, only the top and bottom
properties of `separatorInset` are used, and they control the spacing on the top and bottom of separators.

As with `hidesSeparatorsByDefault`, the `separatorInset` property only applies to new rows that are added.
Rows already in the `AloeStackView` won't be affected.

You can change the separator inset for existing rows with the `setSeparatorInset(forRow:)` and
`setSeparatorInset(forRows:)` methods.

`AloeStackView` also provides properties for customizing the color and width (or thickness) of separators:

```swift
stackView.separatorColor = .blue
stackView.separatorWidth = 2
```
![Add rows](Docs/Images/large_blue_separators.png)

These properties affect all of the separators in the `AloeStackView`.

### Extending AloeStackView

`AloeStackView` is an open class, so it's easy to subclass to add custom functionality without changing the original
source code. Additionally, `AloeStackView` provides two methods that can be used to further extend its capabilities.

#### configureCell(_:)

Every row in an `AloeStackView` is wrapped in a `UIView` subclass called `StackViewCell`. This view is used for
per-row bookkeeping and also manages UI such as separators and insets.

Whenever a row is added or inserted into an `AloeStackView`, the `configureCell(_:)` method is called. This
method is passed the newly created `StackViewCell` for the row.

You can override this method to perform any customization of cells as needed, for example to support custom
features you've added to `AloeStackView` or control the appearance of rows on the screen.

This method is always called after any default values for the cell have been set, so any changes you make in this
method won't be overwritten by the system.

#### cellForRow(_:)

Whenever a row is inserted into an `AloeStackView`, the `cellForRow(_:)` method is called to obtain a new cell for
the row. By default, `cellForRow(_:)` simply returns a new `StackViewCell` that contains the row passed in.

`StackViewCell`, however, is an open class that can be subclassed to add custom behavior and functionality as
needed. To have `AloeStackView` use your custom cell, override `cellForRow(_:)` and return an instance of your
custom subclass.

Providing a custom `StackViewCell` subclass allows much more find-grained control over how rows are displayed. It
also allows custom data to be stored along with each row, which can be useful to support any functionality you add to
`AloeStackView`.

One thing to remember is that `AloeStackView` will apply default values to a cell after it is returned from
`cellForRow(_:)`. Hence, if you need to apply any further customizations to your cell, you should consider doing it in
`configureCell(_:)`.

#### When to Extend AloeStackView

These methods together provide quite a lot of flexibility for extending `AloeStackView` to add custom behavior and
functionality.

For example, you can add new methods to `AloeStackView` to control the way rows are managed, or to support new
types of user interaction. You can customize properties on `StackViewCell` to control the individual appearance of
each row. You can subclass `StackViewCell` to store new data and properties with each row in order to support
custom features you add. Subclassing `StackViewCell` also provides more fine-grained control over how rows are
displayed.

However, this flexibility inevitably comes with a trade-off in terms of complexity and maintenance. `AloeStackView`
has a comprehensive API that can support a wide variety of use cases out-of-the-box. Hence, it's often better to see if
the behavior you need is available through an existing API before resorting to extending the class to add new features.
This can often save time and effort, both in terms of the cost of developing custom functionality as well as ongoing
maintenance.

### When to use AloeStackView

#### The Short Answer

`AloeStackView` is best used for shorter screens with less than a screenful or two of content. It is particularly suited to
screens that accept user input, implement forms, or are comprised of a heterogeneous set of views.

However, it's also helpful to dig a bit deeper into the technical details of `AloeStackView`, as this can help develop a
better understanding of appropriate use cases.

#### More Details

`AloeStackView` is a very useful tool to have in the toolbox. Its straightforward, flexible API allows you to build UI
quickly and easily.

Unlike `UITableView` and `UICollectionView`, you can keep strong references to views in an `AloeStackView` and
make changes to them at any point. This will automatically update the entire UI thanks to Auto Layout - there is no
need to notify `AloeStackView` of the changes.

This makes `AloeStackView` great for use cases such as forms and screens that take user input. In these situations,
it's often convenient to keep a strong reference to the fields a user is editing, and directly update the UI with validation
feedback.

`AloeStackView` has no `reloadData` method, or any way to notify it about changes to your views. This makes it less
error-prone and easier to debug than a class like `UITableView`. For example, `AloeStackView` won't crash if not
notified of changes to the underlying data of the views it manages.

Since `AloeStackView` uses `UIStackView` under the hood, it doesn't recycle views as you scroll. This eliminates
common bugs caused by not recycling views correctly. You also don't need to independently maintain the state of
views as the user interacts with them, which makes it simpler to implement certain kinds of UI.

However, `AloeStackView` is not suitable in all situations. `AloeStackView` lays out the entire UI in a single pass
when your screen loads. As such, longer screens will start seeing a noticeable delay before the UI is displayed for the
first time. This is not a great experience for users and can make an app feel unresponsive to navigation actions.
Hence, `AloeStackView` should not be used when implementing UI with more than a screenful or two of content.

Forgoing view recycling is also a trade-off: while `AloeStackView`  is faster to write UI with and less error-prone, it will
perform worse and use more memory for longer screens than a class like `UITableView`. Hence, `AloeStackView` is
generally not appropriate for screens that contain many views of the same type, all showing similar data. Classes like
`UITableView` or `UICollectionView` often perform better in those situations.

While `AloeStackView` is not the only piece of infrastructure we use to build iOS UI at Airbnb, it has been valuable for
us in many situations. We hope you find it useful too!
